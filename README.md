# MarsColony
![main image] (screenshot/mars-screenshot.png)

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-rc.0.

## Project Goals
Users fill out forms which will post to these APIs which can later be retrieved('get') and viewed.

## Learnings
Using Angular to create a single page application as well as further understanding of getting and posting from APIs.

## Implementations
* Hot Module Reload for faster workflow (`npm run hmr`)
* Get/Post JSON data
* Form Validation
* Home screen animations (modified codepen animations from users theSLY and Aleks)
* Colonist object data stored in local storage

## TODO
* implement ngif if necessary(?)
* router transition animations
* make it more prettier 
* WordPress integration with WP REST API (v2)
* integrate mars map as background 
* implement 'loading' for inbetween loading phases

## Development server
Run `ng serve` or `npm run hmr`(for hot modular reload) for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
